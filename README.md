The third project in Unity. This is an inspiration of the concept from the game 2048 by Gabriele Cirulli.
The game is based on the same assumptions, but allows the player to move not in 4 directions but in 6 directions. In addition, it is not limited by 2048, but there is no upper limit.
I made asset myself, Chatgpt helped me with the code.
